Sure, let's continue updating the `README.md` to include the new PDF generation feature.

3. Generate a PDF of the directory tree and file contents:

   ```sh
   ccontext -p /path/to/directory --generate-pdf
   ```

### Command-Line Arguments

- `-p, --root_path`: The root path to start the directory tree (default: current directory).
- `-e, --excludes`: Additional files or directories to exclude, separated by `|`, e.g., `node_modules|.git`.
- `-i, --includes`: Files or directories to include, separated by `|`, e.g., `important_file.txt|docs`.
- `-m, --max_tokens`: Maximum number of tokens allowed before chunking.
- `-c, --config`: Path to a custom configuration file.
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose output to stdout.
- `-ig, --ignore_gitignore`: Ignore the `.gitignore` file for exclusions.
- `--generate-pdf`: Generate a PDF of the directory tree and file contents.

### Example

```sh
ccontext -p /home/user/project -e ".git|build" -i "README.md|src" --generate-pdf
```
````

### Configuration

You can customize the behavior of `ccontext` by creating a configuration file. The default configuration file is `config.json` located in the user's home directory under `.ccontext`. You can also provide a custom configuration file via the `-c` argument.

### Sample `config.json`

```json
{
  "verbose": false,
  "max_tokens": 120000,
  "model_type": "gpt-4o",
  "buffer_size": 0.05,
  "excluded_folders_files": [
    ".git",
    "bin",
    "build",
    "node_modules",
    "venv",
    "__pycache__",
    "package-lock.json",
    "ccontext.egg-info",
    "dist"
  ],
  "context_prompt": "[[SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS]] The following output presents a detailed directory structure and file contents from a specified root path. The file tree includes both excluded and included files and directories, clearly marking exclusions. Each file's content is displayed with comprehensive headings and separators to enhance readability and facilitate detailed parsing for extracting hierarchical and content-related insights. If the data represents a codebase, interpret and handle it as such, providing appropriate assistance as a programmer AI assistant. [[END SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS]]"
}
```

## Use Cases

- **Codebase Context**: Send the entire codebase as context to an LLM in one go, avoiding the need to copy and paste snippets manually.
- **PDF Documentation**: Generate a comprehensive PDF documentation of the directory structure and file contents, with links to specific sections.

## Future Ideas

Here are some ideas that might be implemented in future versions of `ccontext`:

Future versions of ccontext may include:

- **Document Support:** Incorporate the ability to handle documents such as PDFs and image files in prompts.
- **Binary File Handling:** Introduce mechanisms to manage non-text file types effectively.
